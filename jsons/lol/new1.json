Not because of middle eastern conflicts or China's economic awakening but because it does nothing to curb the tide of bronziocracy. American bronzies are given suffrage and even legal and reproductive rights despite having proved their inferior mental and moral status. In countries like Korea where being the worst at something is shameful people give their all to better themselves. However American culture celebrates mediocrity and encourages bronzies to merely stop playing the game when their self esteem might be tarnished by their inferior performances. Instead of sharpening their minds and, even more importantly, teaching themselves to overcome their inherent genetic disadvantages through hard work, American bronzies transition to smoking cannabis and having unprotected ***. They diminish their mental abilities even further while creating the next generation of bronzies. The only way to curb America's economic decline is the mandatory sterilization of all bronzies. While it would be inhumane to simply eradicate the bronzies America is already saddled with, their negative economic impact can be curbed by leveraging them as farm animals and mannequins.","tags":"#lol#rackier#bronzers#bronzies#bronze#america","favourites":1,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-18T02:24:18.250Z","score":0},{"_id":"5508e1bcb47c3d010fd9657c","id":1128,"pasta":"Low elos should learn to stop back talking diamond 1s or higher. If someone from bronze has an opinion that differs from a diamond 1's, the bronzie should NOT try to reason with the high elo. He shouldn't ask why either. He should take what the diamond says as fact without talking back. Too many times, I've seen a bronzie backtalk a diamond 1, and it's disgusting, because the bronzie is wrong most of the time. The only time a bronzie is right is when 500,000 bronzies are talking back to a single diamond 1. There's a reason why you're stuck in bronze. It's because you think differently than the diamonds.
