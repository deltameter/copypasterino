It's survival of the fittest and you ain't gonna survive long on 4chan by saying stupid jokes that your little hugbox cuntsucking reddit friends would upboat. None of that here. You don't upboat. You don't downboat. This ain't reddit, kid. This is 4chan. We have REAL intellectual discussion, something I don't think you're all that familiar with. You don't like it, you can hit the bricks on over to imgur, you daily show watching son of a bitch. I hope you don't tho. I hope you stay here and learn our ways. Things are different here, unlike any other place that the light of internet pop culture reaches. You can be anything here.

Argue with all dissenting opinions, especially if made by fundie republicans. Have a dank supply of copypasta counter-arguments to put them in their place.\n2. Frequently mention words like senpai, Searnie Banders, Bitcoin, and Linux whilst on online web forums as well as IRL (In Real Life for you pathetic n00bs).\n3. Sit on your arms until they go numb, so the next time you shitpost it's like someone else is shitposting instead.\n4. Every 10 posts, start your comment with \"As an engineer\" (I know you're just a liberal arts pleb but step up your meme game bub.)\n5. Meme early, meme often, and most importantly, meme as much as you can outside of your time with your SO, at your job, exercise, and cooking meals at home allows. Lol JK you have/do none of these 420 blaze it memers top lel!\n6. The greatest thing we could do for fixing the problems we have here on earth would be to quadruple nasas budget with the specific purpose of landing mankind on other planets and sustaining life systems and returning them to earth.

The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth's orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour. They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused over 9000 wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with over 9000 buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles per iron, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not the hardest metal known to man.","tags":"#general#miles#per#iron#diamonds#metal","favourites":263,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-17T23:10:49.326Z","score":0.0008698180539764818},{"_id":"564e06c414bb47530dfef253","id":2341,"pasta":"Hello this is the Pornhub administrator\nWe wanted to say you that you didn't visited our site for 2 weeks now.\nWe got plenty of new videos on your favourite section, the gay section.\nWe hope to see you around again!
