First off, the smell is ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂. Its much better than the smell in my house, which is currently flooded in a pool of shit water from a toilet  I didn't flush. Anyways, other ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 aspects about this ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 restaurant is that the music is very ℱ 𝓪 𝓷 𝓬 𝔂. The music actually made my ᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗ dong ᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗ rise a little bit. So I bet you're wondering about the food. The food is indeed very ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂. I ordered some pasta and I really liked the ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 smell, ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 taste and ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 touch of the pasta, it was all very ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂. Here's my complaint though. I realized that you can't pay with your dong in this particular restaurant. Yep, I asked the waiter if I could show the manager my ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 dong and that could cover my bill. You know what that bitch did? SHE KICKED ME OUT. Like jeez, who doesn't want their eyes to gaze in awe in sight of my very ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 ᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗdongᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗ? This restaurant is ass. Until they allow my ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂  method of payment, i'll give the restaurant 1 out of 10 dong points. More like the \"pASSta palASSe\".","tags":"#general#dongers#reddit","favourites":0,"__v":0,"created_on":"2016-07-08T07:45:54.575Z","score":0},{"_id":"577f5a18c2b85a51055b3181","id":2833,"pasta":"im 13 and just descoverd The Donald, i am now addicted to these dank memes and cannot continue life without this lovely dank dood.

I will continue doing this untill i am donald trump we all spent countless hours on. Plz like to support my belief on becoming this man by liking.

No one ever takes copypastas seriously. I'm being honest here. No one ever stops and really understands the copypastas. They just pass it off as just another shitpost that was made by some edgy shit in his basement, waiting for downvotes and hate comments. These people are wrong. copypastas are made by the greatest minds on the planet. Each one is carefully and delicately crafted to get the least amount of karma on Reddit. I'm led to believe that maybe even Ernest Hemingway made a copypasta. Now, I am not talking about the shitty twitter copypastas that don't take any effort at all, like what you see on say, for example, Berny Snaders' page. They lack a soul. I only speak of 4Chan copypastas and the like. Copypastas that make fun of the saltiness of OP and call his post cancer. These types of copypastas deserve respect. They aren't trash. They are literature.
