Your dipshits are like a fucking EBOLA epidemic, as soon as one shitposter posts anything even remotely related to /s4s/ another 500 crawl out of the woodwork as start spamming, checking dubs and posting unfunny pictures of shit \"memes\" that don't even make any fucking sense. And can we talk about /s4s/'s memes for a second here? It's amazing how the board most obsessed with memes has failed to produce even one meme that isn't complete and utter garbage. The closest thing you cocksuckers had to an actual successful meme was topkek, and even that was ripped off ylilauta. And when was that? Two years ago? What actual real memes did /s4s/ produce since then? Just a whole bunch of frankly quite boring pictures with zero humor or exploitability. It's no wonder that nothing from this self-declared \"OC factory\" ever actually spreads to other boards. This is painfully pathetic to watch. Most of you aren't even being ironic anymore. Some of you actually actually come here and in full sincerity participate in this circlejerk. You excuse your actions by saying mindbogglingly idiotic shit like \"this is like old /b/! lel so random\", but guess what retards: I've been on 4chan since 2006 and this place is nothing, NOTHING like old /b/. Fucking STOP SAYING THAT YOU PIECES OF SHIT. That's outright OFFENSIVE to anyone who's seen what pre-2007 /b/ looked like. You nuggets of cancer perfectly embody everything that KILLED old /b/. It's like someone took the 2008-era cancer, took THE VERY WORST PARTS of it, concentrated it to 200% levels and then wrapped it in a painfully thin veil of \"irony\".\n\nYou know? I ain't even mad.

I understand many people do not believe the Bible and its teachings, but since this picture chooses to attack the topic from within the confines of the Bible I will defend it from the same position. The first claim, \"Jesus never uttered a word about same-sex relationships,\" is technically correct. However, Christ does address the topic in two implied ways. The first way is found in Matthew 19:4-7 where in response to the Pharisees' question on divorce Christ replies by defining marriage. It reads, \"'Haven't you read the Scriptures?' Jesus replied. 'They record that from the beginning 'God made them male and female.'' And he said, ''This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.' Since they are no longer two but one, let no one split apart what God has joined together.'\" Jesus also in his ministry instructs his followers to abstain from all sexual immorality or infidelity, which is any sexual activity outside of marriage. By this logic while Christ never deliberately says, \"Thou shalt not partake in homosexuality,\" His teaching certainly leans against it. The second way Christ addresses the topic is through his disciples, later the apostles. Christ tells His disciples after he departs the Holy Spirit will descend upon them and teach them everything they need to know. So when we read the New Testament, Christ and the Holy Spirit, are speaking through the apostles and their writings ( see 2 Timothy 3:16). So yes, Christ never deliberately says homosexuality is a sin but his teaching certainly leans in that direction. The second claim and question relating to the Old Testament and obeying every command and the implied question, \"Why don't Christians obey every other command?\" is directly related to Christ's work on the cross. When Christ was crucified, died, and rose again, he created a new covenant of grace and faith different from the one of the law and Moses. However, Christ did not do this by abolishing the law he did this by fulfilling. So we cannot just simply ignore the law, but instead learn from it. The purpose of the law was to show the Israelites their need for a savior and the glory of God, once Christ came and became the perfect mediator between us and God it allowed us to praise and glorify God without the law. Thus, Christians are not simply ignoring the law of old, they are simply evaluating what laws are no longer needed because of the work of Christ or are not going to have a major impact. This is why the Apostle Paul writes, \"All things are now permissible, but not all are beneficial.\" So when the Old Testament considers homosexuality along with a multitude of other sexual sins as \"abominations\" and sexual sin including homosexuality is one of the few laws specifically restated in the New Testament believers certainly ought to take these sins seriously and be proactive against them. The following claim regarding a word and cultural study of homosexuality in the New Testament is simply not telling the whole story. Certainly male prostitution, molestation, or promiscuity are all things is talking about, but he is also talking about normal homosexual relationships. To say anything less than this is taking the scripture and word out of context. The following claim Paul said women should be silent and never assume authority over a man takes scripture out of context in the same way. 1 Corinthians 7:3-4 says, \"The husband should fulfill his wife's sexual needs, and the wife should fulfill her husband's needs. The wife gives authority over her body to her husband, and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife.\" Ephesians 5:21-33 continues to elaborate on this message ending with the beautiful line, \"So again I say, each man must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.\" This is not a commanding abusive relationship this picture is trying to allude to, this is a committed loving relationship in which mutual respect, authority, and love in their different roles is present between a man and woman. The fourth claim regarding the population of the earth is simply illogical on a number of levels. First if God had wanted to create two men and given them the ability to procreate together he could have. Secondly why would God not specifically define a relationship between two men or two women? Instead in Genesis 2:24 Moses writes, \"This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.\" The earth's need to be populated, played no part in God's choice to create man and women. The final claim on how the Bible defines marriage is also a twisting of scripture and misunderstanding. Just because there are marriages in the Bible that are polygamous or involve concubines does not mean they are condoned by the Bible. Same with the rape of people as well as prisoners or slaves of war. Yes these relationships take place, but the Bible never condones these actions or defines marriage by them. Instead the Bible defines marriage the ways I have already referenced in Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19, and Ephesians 5. The final thing I would like to address is the last argument and response, \"Because it just disgusts me.\" Speaking on behalf of the Christian community I am deeply sorry for the way many believers have responded and treated the LGBT community. We are commanded to share the gospel, the truth of the word of God, and reasons for our faith, but we are commanded to do this in love. Unfortunately the love has been left out our approach in many ways. Legalism, unjust judgement, and selfishness have become bad habits of many believers and churches. So I say to homosexuals, Jesus Christ loves you. I personally love you and am constantly in prayer for you. Yes I believe the lifestyle you have chosen is a sin, but that does not change your ability to come to God the father, believe in his son Jesus Christ and accept the beautiful gift of salvation. I understand you may feel born into homosexuality, it is who you are, I feel the same way in my relationship to lust, alcohol, anger, and a number of other sins in my life. I promise you though, if you place your hope and faith in Jesus Christ he will mold your heart and sanctify you in his truths. You don't have to clean up your act to come to church, you simply must confess your sin to Christ Jesus, call him Lord, and ask him to save you. Trust me he will. God bless and please, whether a christian or non-christian, take these truths to heart and always minister in love.","tags":"#general#believer#jesus#christ#gays#tldr","favourites":5,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-06-30T18:11:52.510Z","score":0.00041335237473051845},{"_id":"559743f7a28b796c71d39f0a","id":1846,"pasta":"[Get your own Ellen Pao Pasta](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=Rz7DUcRK)\n\n                  ''####+' ''+++   '\n                '++##@@@@@@@#@#+'++###'\n               +####@###@####@@####+++###'\n             ''###+++##++###+++##@@@##+####+           Ellen Pao:\n             ######+#++++++###+'++###@@@+####          1.
