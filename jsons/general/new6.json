The town square was bustling and crowded and busy ponies filled the streets. All the pony folk seemed to have somewhere specific to be. All except Rainbow Dash; her place was in the sky. She tore freely through the air, speeding one way and the next, buzzing the tree tops and racing the wind. The blue pegasus swooped over a schoolyard, much to the delight of the children, then climbed several hundred feet and dove, streaking downward as fast as she could. Seconds before hitting the ground, her wings flew open and she pulled up back into the clear blue. Rainbow felt alive.\nSuddenly, Dash remembered that she had somewhere to be; she was supposed to meet with Pinkie Pie in five minutes. Dash had gotten so caught up in her exercises that she‚Äôd nearly forgotten that Pinkie had asked to meet her at Sugercube Corner at three. Pinkie hadn‚Äôt said why or what they‚Äôd be doing, but Dash knew that with Pinkie, it could be anything. Dash wasn‚Äôt sure if she really wanted to go, though. She was so engaged with her stunts that she thought about blowing Pinkie off to continue flying. But, Dash‚Äôs conscience got the better of her. She knew that it would hurt Pinkie‚Äôs feelings; after all, Pinkie had said it was going to be something special just for the two of them. Dash considered it and thought ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù What did she have to lose? Heck, it might be more pranking. Pinkie might have found a bunch more fun stuff to pull on folks, and they‚Äôd had so much fun the last time. Dash kicked into overdrive to make up for lost time, and sped to her appointment.\nWhen Dash walked into the store, she was immediately greeted by her host, who was bouncing in excitement.  ‚ÄúYay, you‚Äôre here! I‚Äôve been waiting aaall day,‚Äù said the jumping pony.\n‚ÄúSorry if I‚Äôm a little late, Pinkie.  I was doing my afternoon exercises and lost track of time,‚Äù Dash apologized.\nPinkie giggled and responded in a gleefully reassuring tone, ‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs ok, you‚Äôre here now. What‚Äòs a few more minutes? I‚Äôve been sooo excited thinking about all fun stuff we‚Äôre gonna do, I haven‚Äôt stopped bouncing since I woke up. I mean, I almost forgot to breathe I‚Äôve been so happy.‚Äù\nDash gave a slightly uncomfortable laugh. She had always appreciated Pinkie Pie‚Äôs friendly, outgoing way of life, but Pinkie‚Äôs overabundant enthusiasm almost creeped her out.  Dash maintained a polite expression, however. If Pinkie was this worked up, whatever she had planned must be good.\n‚ÄúSo, you ready to get started, Rainbow Dash? I‚Äôve got everything all ready,‚Äù the pink pony said.\nDash psyched herself up. ‚ÄúYou betcha, Pinkie. So what do ya got planed? We gonna prank somebody? I got a couple of good ones I‚Äôve been thinking about. Or maybe you‚Äôve got some stunts you think I should try? Or perhaps‚Ä¶‚Äù\n‚ÄúMAKING CUPCAKES!‚Äù Pinkie happily announced.\n‚ÄúBaking?‚Äù Dash was disappointed. ‚ÄúPinkie, you know I‚Äôm not good at baking. Remember last time?‚Äù\n‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs not a problem at all. I only need your help making them. I‚Äôll be doing most of the work,‚Äù Pinkie explained.\nDash thought for about it for a second. ‚ÄúWell, alright, I guess that‚Äôs ok. What exactly do you need me to do?‚Äù\n‚ÄúThat‚Äôs the spirit. Here you go.‚Äù Pinkie handed Dash a cupcake.\nDash was puzzled ‚ÄúI thought I was helping you bake.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou will be. I made this one just for you before you got here.\n‚ÄúSo, is this like taste testing or something?‚Äù\n‚ÄúSorta,‚Äù Pinkie said.\nDash shrugged and popped the pastry in her mouth. She chewed a bit and swallowed. Not bad.\n‚ÄúOk, now what?‚Äù Dash asked.\n‚ÄúNow,‚Äù Pinkie informed her, ‚ÄúYou take a nap.‚Äù\nPuzzled, Dash opened her mouth but felt instantly lightheaded. A wave of dizziness washed over her, the world spun, and seconds later she collapsed to the floor.\n\nWhen Dash regained consciousness, she found herself in a dark room. She tried to shake her head but found that a taut leather strap held it firmly in place. She struggled to move, but braces around her chest and limbs glued her to a rack formed from a series of sturdy planks, which spread her legs wide apart. Dash‚Äôs wings were the only part of her not tied down, and they fluttered frantically while she struggled to escape.  As she writhed, Pinkie jumped suddenly into her line of sight.\n‚ÄúGoodie, you‚Äôre awake. Now we can get started,‚Äù Pinkie stated gleefully. She bounded into the darkness, and quickly reappeared pushing a small cart covered with a cloth.\n‚ÄúPinkie, what‚Äôs going on? I can‚Äôt move!‚Äù Dash said urgently.\n‚ÄúWell duh, that‚Äôs because you‚Äôre tied down,‚Äù chided Pinkie.  ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt move. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd need to be told that.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBut why? What‚Äôs happening? I thought you said I was going to help make cupcakes.‚Äù\n‚ÄúYou are helping. You see, I ran out of the special ingredient and I need you to get more.‚Äù\n‚ÄúSpecial ingredient?‚Äù Dash was now breathing heavily and starting to panic. ‚ÄúWhat special ingredient?‚Äù\nPinkie giggled and responded ‚ÄúYou, silly!‚Äù\nDash‚Äôs eyes widened, and her face contorted in fear. Then she started to laugh and said, in a voice bordering on hysteria, ‚ÄúWoo, you really got me there, Pinkie pie. I mean, tricking me in to thinking I‚Äôm gonna get made into a cupcake? I gotta tell you, this the best prank yet. You win, you‚Äôre the best.‚Äù\nPinkie only giggled even more. ‚ÄúAw, thanks Dash. But I haven‚Äôt done any pranks today, so I can‚Äôt accept your praise.‚Äù\nDash was struggling again. ‚ÄúPinkie, come on, this isn‚Äôt funny.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThen why were you laughing?‚Äù Before Dash could answer, Pinkie grabbed the cloth and whipped it off the cart. On the cart was a tray containing various sharp medical tools and knives, carefully organized and wickedly sharp, as well as a large medical bag.\nDash was now in full panic mode. She was starting to hyperventilate. Her mind raced as she tried to reason with the pink pony. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt do this Pinkie! I‚Äôm your friend!‚Äù\n‚ÄúI know you are and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm so happy that I‚Äôve got you here. We get to share your last moments together, just you and me.‚Äù Pinkie was skipping again.\n‚ÄúBut, the other ponies will wonder where I am. When the clouds pile up, they‚Äôll come looking for me and then you‚Äôll get found out,‚Äù Dash cried in desperation.\n‚ÄúOh, Dash,‚Äù said Pinkie. ‚ÄúDon‚Äòt worry, there are plenty of pegasus ponies to take care of a few clouds. And besides, no one will find out. I mean, how long do you think I‚Äôve been doing this?‚Äù And with that ominous statement, the lights suddenly came to life and revealed the rest the room.\n‚ÄúOh no.‚Äù Dash reeled in horror at the image presented to her. The room was decorated with a typical but twisted Pinkie Pie flair. Colorful streamers of dried entrails fluttered around on the ceiling, brightly painted skulls of all sizes were attached to the walls, and organs done up in pastels filled with helium were tied to the backs of chairs. The tables and chairs were made of bones and the preserved flesh of past ponies. Dash cringed upon seeing the center piece of the table nearest to her. The heads of four foals, their eyes closed as if they were sleeping, were wearing party hats made from their own skin. With a thrill of terror, Dash recognized one of them as Apple Bloom‚Äôs classmate Twist. Dash‚Äôs eyes darted back and forth and then fell upon a patchwork banner hanging from the rafters.  Made from several tanned pony hides, the words ‚ÄúLife is a party‚Äù were scrawled on it in blood red.\nDash‚Äôs attention was brought back by a party horn unfurling and tickling her nose. She gaped at Pinkie Pie, who was standing right in front of her. The party pony was wearing a dress quilted from dried skin, emblazoned with cutie marks. On her back fluttered six pegasus wings, all of different colors. As the earth pony skipped in excitement, her necklace of severed unicorn horns clacked together loudly.\n‚ÄúLike it?‚Äù Pinkie asked. ‚ÄúI made it myself.‚Äù\nDesperately, Dash pleaded with the smiling pony before her. ‚ÄúPinkie please, I‚Äôm sorry if I did anything to you. I didn‚Äôt mean it. Please let me go. I promise I won‚Äôt tell anybody.‚Äù\n‚ÄúOh Dash, you didn‚Äôt do anything. It‚Äôs just that your number came up and, well, I don‚Äôt make rules. We can‚Äôt turn back now.‚Äù\nDash was tearing up. How could this be happening?\n‚ÄúAww, don‚Äôt be sad Dash,‚Äù said Pinkie.  ‚ÄúLook, this‚Äôll cheer you up. I brought you a friend.‚Äù\nSeemingly out of nowhere, Pinkie produced a brightly painted blue and yellow skull. It was about pony sized, but it had a very defining feature: a beak.\nDash gaped in shock. ‚ÄúIs‚Ä¶is that‚Ä¶.is‚Ä¶that?‚Äù\n‚ÄúHey, Dash lets hang together. These ponies are lame-os. Dweebs dweebs dweebs,‚Äù Pinkie mimicked. ‚ÄúI caught her right before she left town. Remember when I left the party for about twenty minutes? That wasn‚Äôt enough time to play with her of course; I had to wait till after the party to do that. But boy am I glad I did. It was worth it for the flavor alone. Griffons taste like two animals at once, it‚Äôs amazing. I know she didn‚Äôt have a number like everyone else in Ponyville, but when was I gonna get another chance to try griffon? I probably should have asked where she came from so I could have gotten more, but I forgot. I‚Äôll tell you what though, she was quite the fighter. She lasted a long time, which was a lot of fun for me. I got the chance to play with somebody other than a pony and try new things. It‚Äôs too bad she had such a meanie mouth. She said so much bad stuff I just had to take her tongue out. You know, bad language makes for bad feelings, Rainbow Dash.‚Äù\nDash didn‚Äôt have anything to say. She just sobbed and writhed in her tight bonds.\n‚ÄúWell‚Äù said Pinkie with an air of finality, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough reminiscing. It‚Äôs time to begin.‚Äù\nPutting down Gilda‚Äôs skull, the pink pony gripped a scalpel in the cleft of her hoof and walked over to Dash‚Äôs right flank. Without any flair, Pinkie placed the blade an inch above Dash‚Äôs cutie mark and began a circular cut around it. Dash shouted in pain and tried desperately to pull away, but the braces held her still. Finishing the incision, Pinkie grabbed a curved skinning knife from the tray. Screwing up her face in concentration, she worked it under Dash‚Äôs skin and sliced the hide away from the muscle. Dash ground her teeth as she tearfully watched her flesh peel off. Pinkie then moved to the other side and repeated the process on Dash‚Äôs left flank. Once she had finished, Pinkie held up both cutie marks in front of her friend and started waving them like pompoms. Dash just whimpered. Her thighs burned like nothing she had felt before.\nPlacing the ragged patches of skin down, Pinkie selected a large butcher knife and walked behind the blue pegasus. ‚ÄúHope you don‚Äôt mind, I think I‚Äôm gonna wing it now,‚Äù Pinkie laughed. She grabbed Dash‚Äôs left wing in her mouth and played with it for a few seconds, yanking it back so the sharp pain reignited the fire in Dash‚Äôs flanks. Then, stretching the wing out, Pinkie brought the blade down hard at the base. Instantly, Dash screamed and thrashed her appendage. The movement threw off Pinkie‚Äôs aim. She tried to hit the mark again but missed, and carved a huge slice into Dash‚Äôs back.\n‚ÄúDash, you gotta stay still or I‚Äôll keep missing,‚Äù scolded Pinkie as her friend howled.\nPinkie took another whack and hit her target. She swung again and again. Blood sprayed into the air, but Pinkie realized she wasn‚Äôt getting anywhere. The blade just wasn‚Äôt going through the bone.\n‚ÄúHmm, I guess I forgot to sharpen it. I‚Äôll try something else,‚Äù stated Pinkie matter-of-factly as she tossed the knife over her shoulder, embedding the blade in the table.  Through the haze of pain and tears, Dash heard the sound of a metal box opening and closing.\n‚ÄúGot it! Say Dash, why do they call it a hack saw? It doesn‚Äôt hack; hacking is what I was doing with the knife. This is a saw. I don‚Äôt get it.‚Äù\nPinkie placed the tool over the mangled flesh of the last attempt. Standing on her hind legs, she worked the saw back and forth with her front hooves.  It sliced effortlessly through the bone and skin. The feeling of the jagged teeth grinding into her made Dash want to vomit. She watched numbly as her wing flew over her head and landed with a fluff on the table.  Pinkie moved to the next wing and started sawing. Dash didn‚Äôt struggle this time; she‚Äôd given up trying to fight and focused on choking back screams of agony. Abruptly, the sawing paused. Pinkie was only half way done, the wing hanging off by a sliver.\n‚ÄúHey Dash,‚Äù Pinkie piped up. ‚ÄúThink fast!‚Äù\nSuddenly, Pinkie yanked the wing as hard as she could. The bone snapped but the blue pony‚Äôs skin held, then tore away. The pull ripped away a long strip of flesh all the way down Dash‚Äôs back to her rump. Her body seized at the unexpected trauma. As her pelvis tensed up, Dash felt a warm release between her legs, and her loud, unending melody of pain filled the room. Unable to catch her breath, she blacked out.\n\nDash awoke with a gasp. The stench of her urine filled her mucus caked nostrils. As her vision swam into focus, she saw a very pouty Pinkie Pie removing a large adrenaline needle from her chest. Stomping her hooves, the frustrated Pinkie lashed out at her helpless victim.\n‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt anybody teach you any manners? It‚Äôs very rude to fall asleep when somebody invites you over to spend time with them. How would you like it if I came over to your house and went to sleep? ‚ÄòOh I‚Äôm sorry Dash, you‚Äôre so boring I think I‚Äôll take a nap.‚Äô You think I like always doing this by myself? I told you how excited I got when I found you were next. I was excited to have a friend be here with me while I worked. But NOOOOO! You‚Äôve got to be inconsiderate. You know, I thought you were tough. I thought you could handle anything. I‚Äôve had foals stand up better than you!  Do I have to baby you? Huh? Is that how you want me to remember you, as a baby?‚Äù\nAs Pinkie stopped to catch her breath, Dash blinked and sobbed softly. Her back was in agony, her sides were on fire, and there was an intense pain in one of her legs. As she blinked again, she saw Pinkie pop something red into her mouth and began to chew. Noticing Dash‚Äôs stare, Pinkie quickly gulped the morsel down.\n‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Pinkie asked. ‚ÄúOh, this?‚Äù She held up another piece. ‚ÄúWell, while YOU were asleep, I got a little impatient and helped myself to a small sample. I got it from your leg; you‚Äôre not bad. Wanna try some?‚Äù\nWithout waiting for a response, Pinkie shoved the strip of meat into the revolted pegasus pony‚Äôs mouth. Dash gagged, and immediately spit it out. Pinkie frowned, and picked up the chunk of flesh. ‚ÄúIf you didn‚Äôt want it, you could have said no.‚Äù She contemplated the discarded snotty morsel, then gulped it up. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like you haven‚Äôt had my cupcakes before.‚Äù\nSwallowing, Pinkie turned her attention to a small can on the tray. She removed the lid, revealing that it was filled with red-hot coals. Lying on top of the coals were several large nails. As the adrenalin filled her veins, Dash began to panic again. Picking up the can, Pinkie walked over to Dash‚Äôs left. Holding some tongs with her mouth, Pinkie carefully picked up a nail and positioned it at the seam between her victim‚Äôs front left leg and hoof. She then grabbed a hammer and took careful aim. \n‚ÄúNo Pinkie!‚Äù Dash screamed. ‚ÄúNO! NO!‚Äù\nThe hammer came down and the nail punctured Dash‚Äôs skin. The white hot burning was too much.  Dash screamed as she pulled and thrashed at the braces, causing her raw skin to rub and tear. Pinkie tried to line up another nail, but couldn‚Äôt find her aim, and let out a frustrated grunt. When Pinkie brought the hammer back to take a wild swing, Dash burst out crying and begging.\n‚ÄúPLEASE STOP! PLEASE, PLEASE STOP!‚Äù\nPinkie rolled her eyes.  Putting down the hammer and tongs, she walked back in front of her friend and stared pensively at the broken pegasus. Gilda didn‚Äôt even cry this much when she had a live parasprite stuffed down her throat. Pinkie thought for a minute about what to do next, then had a sudden spark of inspiration.\nRotating a wheel on the rack, Pinkie laid Dash on her back, then moved to Dash‚Äôs hind legs, bringing the can with her. Picking up her tools, Pinkie drove a searing hot spike of metal directly into the bottom of Dash‚Äôs hoof. As Dash yelled in pain, Pinkie moved around and drove a second nail into the other hoof. Next, Pinkie went back to her cart and located an enormous battery and controller, which she dragged over to where she was working. She tied copper wires between the terminals and the nails driven into Dash‚Äôs hooves, then gave Dash a wink and flipped the switch.\nElectricity rocketed through Dash‚Äôs body. The blue pony reacted immediately; her body seized, and her muscles snapped taut. Dash‚Äôs hips thrust skyward, her eyes rolled back, and she let out a deep, throat shredding cry. Pinkie giggled and danced in place, then reached down and turned up the juice. Dash convulsed uncontrollably, and her bladder emptied once more.\n\nAfter about five minutes, Pinkie shut off the power. Wisps of steam rose from the singed fur around Dash‚Äôs hooves, and the area reeked of cooked flesh and burnt enamel.  Pinkie rotated Dash upright again and tried snap the drooling, delirious pony back to attention.\n‚ÄúDash? Dash! Rainbow Dash, wake up!‚Äù Dash moaned and managed to give a modicum of weak acknowledgment.  Pinkie studied her handiwork, then reached into the medicine bag and produced a large syringe. ‚ÄúAlright, time for the last round.‚Äù\nDash focused blearily on the needle, which Pinkie took as a question as to what it was.\n‚ÄúThis is a little something to take the pain away,‚Äù Pinkie informed Dash as she walked around to her victim‚Äôs ruined back. Dash flinched as Pinkie jabbed the needle into the lower part of the blue pony‚Äôs spine. Moving in front of her friend again, Pinkie leaned down and elaborated.\n‚ÄúIn a few minutes, you won‚Äôt be able to feel anything below your ribcage. Then you‚Äôll be able to stay awake to watch the harvest.‚Äù\nDash started to cry again. ‚ÄúPinkie?‚Äù she choked out.\n‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù\n‚ÄúI want to go home,‚Äù Dash sobbed.\n‚ÄúYeah, I can see wanting to do that,‚Äù replied the party pony. ‚ÄúSometimes, I just wanna give up, just say ‚ÄòI‚Äôm done with this mess‚Äô and go to bed. But you know what? You can‚Äôt shrug off your responsibilities. You got to pull yourself up and meet the challenges head on. That‚Äôs the only way you‚Äôre gonna get ahead in life.‚Äù\nDash hung her head and cried.\nMinutes passed as the drug took effect. Eventually, Dash was completely numb from her chest to her flanks. At this point, Pinkie approached with a scalpel. Glancing at Dash and smiling, Pinkie made a long horizontal cut across the pegasus pony‚Äôs pelvis, just above her crotch. Moving up Dash‚Äôs body, Pinkie made a similar incision under her ribs. Finally, Pinkie made a long vertical cut down Dash‚Äôs stomach, connecting the first two.\n‚ÄúLooks like I got my ‚ÄòI‚Äô on you, Dash,‚Äù Pinkie giggled.\nWith a moist, gooey sound, the flaps of skin opened. The sight of her own organs and the lack of feeling caused Dash‚Äôs breathing to intensify. Pinkie carefully sliced open Dash‚Äôs abdominal sac and grabbed her large intestines. As she separated the organ from the rest of the digestive tract and pulled it out of the new cavity, Pinkie grew jovial. Laughing as she gutted her friend, Pinkie began to make jokes. Dash, growing weaker from this new source of blood loss, tried desperately to shut out the macabre comedy act.\n‚ÄúLook at me, I‚Äôm Rarity!‚Äù Pinkie laughed, slinging the intestinal tube around her neck and spraying blood in all directions. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt my new scarf soooo pretty?‚Äù\nReaching back inside, she sliced the smaller intestine off from the bowls. Squeezing out the excess excrement, Pinkie filed the slimy organ through her teeth and dragged it back and forth. ‚ÄúDentists say you gotta floss every day, Dash.‚Äù\nDash was barely aware of what was going on anymore. The shock was causing her to fade. Disappointed, Pinkie dived back into the blue pony‚Äôs guts, ramping up her routine.\n‚ÄúAw, don‚Äôt go yet Dash.‚Äù Pinkie started pulling out the rest of ","tags":"#general#cupcakes#story#mlp#mylittlepony","favourites":18,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-05-20T03:45:07.257Z","score":0.0006722764329418506},{"_id":"555d5508df71aa25492f2f8c","id":1662,"pasta":"Kiddo, dead fucking you're.

I'm curious... What ever happened to classy men? I may only be 21 but any time I leave the house I dress in a suit similar to this picture\nmy mom took of me a few days ago. \n\nNot only that but I also have a nice watch and as you can see I appreciate the finer things in life as evidenced by that bottle of bubbly I'm cradling. Randomly hop in to my car and you will hear Frank Sinatra playing softly but audibly in the background.\n\nI can't help but laugh when I walk around the mall and see kids my age dressed like crap swinging an attractive young female on their arm as they walk into hot topic or whatever to buy another dumb tee shirt while I am on my way to Brooks Brothers or Jos A Bank for some fine threads. Sure, they may have a girlfriend now but when that girl sees me she sees husband material. I know that when I get a bit older I'll finally have my first girlfriend because by that time all of the girls will already be past that phase of dating A-holes and will be looking for a nice, sweet, sophisticated and slightly mysterious gentleman to spend the rest of their life with.\nI guess that's what the point of my rant is. Why don't girls these days appreciate a well dressed man? I was really born in the wrong decade. I'm an old would trapped in a young body. \nHere's to hoping the classy ness of the 1940s returns one day.","tags":"#4chan#classy","favourites":4,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-05-16T22:37:37.034Z","score":0.00015195970508571574},{"_id":"55552186d8a10121136da80a","id":1635,"pasta":"I want to turn into Luna's bodysuit\nShe wouldn't notice anything weird and wear me into the battle\nAnd then I would tease her naughty bits\nI would gently lick her nipples and play with her cunny\nNot too much though, just enough to get her aroused\nAs she would kill more enemies and get carried away by the slaughter I would increase my \"assault\"\nBy the end of the battle she would be very close and I would give her the pleasure of finishing the \"job\" herself, enjoying every last drop she let into me\nHowever, the story wouldn't end here\nMuch to her surprise, she wouldn't be able to take me off\nMultiple tongues I would've grown inside the suit would caress her plump breasts, stiff nipples, perfect tummy, fit ass and her clitoris\nI would grow two penises right inside the suit which would fill her unexperienced pussy and virgin ass\nThey would vibrate as she moaned and quivered around, helpless and increasingly aroused\nTwo pulsing penises inside her loin and tongues working every single inch of her body wouldn't take too long to bring her to another pleasant ending\nThat wouldn't be it yet though\nFor the last stage, I would begin to pump her with my penises while intensely vibrating around her erogenous zones\nAfter giving her yet another orgasm, I would turn back into a fat-ass self insert and run away","tags":"#dota2#luna#4chan#bodysuit","favourites":50,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-05-14T21:42:30.687Z","score":0.0015187317919047297}]
