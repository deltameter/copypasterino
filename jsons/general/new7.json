Down threw tech chase and wouldn't stop shino stalling I really cannot think straight right now. I offered to MM him for more than $20. Nope. I thought I would have made it out of pools if I knew how to fucking buffer roll. But they didn't even give me the frames to do it. Bullshit, just straight up bullshit. Probably will never go to a tournament that gay ass sheiks enter ever again.

I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the sick spins stormtrooper academy, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on resistance bases, and I have over 300 confirmed sick spins. I am trained in loyal warfare and I'm the top  in the entire first order. You are nothing to me but just another traitor. I will wipe you the traitor out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in this galaxy, mark my words. You think you can get away with saying that to me over the battlefield? Think again, traitor. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of stormtroopers across the galaxy and your ass is being hunted right now so you better prepare for the invasion, traitor. The invasion that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call the resistance. You're fucking dead, traitor. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred sick spins, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in sick spins combat, but I have access to the entire armory of the first order and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the galaxy, you little traitor. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you traitor. I will spin fury all over you and you will die from it.
