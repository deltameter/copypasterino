You said a \"jackdaw is a crow.\"\n\nIs it in the same family? Yes. No one's arguing that.\n\nAs someone who is a scientist who studies crows, I am telling you, specifically, in science, no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be \"specific\" like you said, then you shouldn't either. They're not the same thing.\n\nIf you're saying \"crow family\" you're referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae, which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.\n\nSo your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people \"call the black ones crows?\" Let's get grackles and blackbirds in there, then, too.\n\nAlso, calling someone a human or an ape? It's not one or the other, that's not how taxonomy works. They're both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But that's not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow, which is not true unless you're okay with calling all members of the crow family crows, which means you'd call blue jays, ravens, and other birds crows, too. Which you said you don't.\n\nIt's okay to just admit you're wrong, you know?","tags":"#reddit#unidan#jackdaw#crow#wrong","favourites":528,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-17T18:38:13.871Z","score":0.001556461604895669},{"_id":"56b8f1a56a87c39f5b27153c","id":2504,"pasta":"hi google it's me again do you have any more memes like rEALLY REALLY good memes that will make me side splitting laugh and it will make me feel like my organs are bursting but they realLLY ARENT PLOT TWIST HAHAHA so do you have any memes that will make me laugh that hard? last time i laughed that hard i was watching one of pewdiepie (how's it going bros) and he was playing happy wheels and ANYONE WHO PLAYS HAPPY WHEELS IS A YOUTUBE COPY BY THE WAY and he made a FUNNY joke and i was LAUGH FOR HOURS AHAHAHAAHA so i need memes that will make me laugh that hard again ok? thank you very much it means a lot to me and i'm glad you can supply me with memes like that ok byeeee!!!!!!!!!","tags":"#google#meme#general","favourites":92,"__v":0,"created_on":"2016-02-08T19:51:01.083Z","score":0.0015226832225939397},{"_id":"564e1b9714bb47530dfef25b","id":2349,"pasta":"wow dude you just memed harder than anyone i've ever seen on this website.

It’s fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills. But you know what I like more than materialistic things? Knowledge. In fact, I’m a lot more proud of these seven new bookshelves that I had to get installed to hold two thousand new books that I bought. It’s like the billionaire Warren Buffett says, “the more you learn, the more you earn.”\nNow maybe you’ve seen my TEDx talk where I talk about how I read a book a day. You know, I read a book a day not to show off it’s again about the knowledge. In fact, the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it’s a reminder. A reminder that dreams are still possible, because it wasn’t that long ago that I was in a little town across the country sleeping on a couch in a mobile home with only forty seven dollars in my bank account. I didn’t have a college degree, I had no opportunities.\nBut you know what? Something happened that changed my life. I bumped into a mentor. And another mentor. And a few more mentors. I found five mentors. And they showed me what they did to become multimillionaires. Again, it’s not just about money, it’s about the good life; health, wealth, love and happiness. And so I record a little video, it’s actually on my website, you can click here on this video and it’ll take you to my website where I share three things that they taught me. Three things that you can implement today no matter where you are.\nNow, this isn’t a “get rich quick” scheme. You know, like they say if things sound too good to be true they are too good to be true. I’m not promising you that tomorrow you’re gonna be able to go out and buy a Lamborghini. But what I am telling you is that it can happen faster than you think if you know the proven steps. So, I record a little two minute video on my website. Like I said, now it’s not the most professional I just shot it here with my iPhone, but it’s real. Nobody can argue, this is my true story. And I’m going to give you the three most important things you can do today. So click the link, go there it’s completely free to watch it it’s just a couple minutes. Invest in yourself. Always be curious. Don’t be a cynic. Okay, people see videos like this and they say “Ah that’s not real that’s for somebody else.”\nDon’t listen, don’t listen. Be an optimist. Like, Conrad Hilton, the man who started Hilton Hotel, he said that he was only fifteen years old when he read a book by Helen Keller, and that book changed his life. Books can change your life. And in that book, Helen Keller said “optimism” so if you’re a cynic, if you’re a pessimist you don’t need to click here. Don’t worry about it, I don’t need to talk to everybody. But if you’re somebody who knows that there’s something better, cause the dream is possible, you know, for some of you watching it’s not necessarily a Lamborghini, maybe it’s a new job, a new opportunity, starting your own company.\nMaybe it’s a new lifestyle without so much stress, traveling the world, doing those things you know you’re destined to do. You can do those unless you understand finances. Money, I don’t call it money anymore, I call it fuel units. You must have enough fuel units to live out your dream and to live out your destiny. So, I’ll see you on my website, it’s a quick video and you’ll see there absolutely free.\nSo just click this video and you’ll be taken there in a second, and uh, I’m excited to share this amazing stuff. You’ll see, not because of anything of me but because I’ve been fortunate enough to learn from mentors many years ahead of me. Not just in books like these, although I love books but also real in-person mentors. So let me share with you these three tips that have made all the difference in my life. They’re practical, you can do them today, you can start on them today. All right? See you there on my site.","tags":"#Lambo,#getrich#youtube#general","favourites":147,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-11-19T21:26:23.690Z","score":0.001321436752560995},{"_id":"5742b8d6709549ef048c4b7f","id":2795,"pasta":"Hello ᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗ My name is copy-pasterino and I am currently on a quest to visit every Forum page and Chat room, Please help me on my adventure by pasting me everywhere you see thank you!","tags":"#general#youtube#Adventure#CopyPasterino#Quest","favourites":14,"__v":0,"created_on":"2016-05-23T08:01:26.581Z","score":0.001305402291415632}]
