No one ever takes copypastas seriously. I'm being honest here. No one ever stops and really understands the copypastas. They just pass it off as just another shitpost that was made by some edgy shit in his basement, waiting for downvotes and hate comments. These people are wrong. copypastas are made by the greatest minds on the planet. Each one is carefully and delicately crafted to get the least amount of karma on Reddit. I'm led to believe that maybe even Ernest Hemingway made a copypasta. Now, I am not talking about the shitty twitter copypastas that don't take any effort at all, like what you see on say, for example, Berny Snaders' page. They lack a soul. I only speak of 4Chan copypastas and the like. Copypastas that make fun of the saltiness of OP and call his post cancer. These types of copypastas deserve respect. They aren't trash. They are literature.

I have printed out his picture of him onto paper and blended them up with my hentai anime books and multiple donald trump memes in my dank nutri-ninja blender and then poured it into a syringe and injected it directly into my genital area. I will continue doing this untill i am donald trump we all spent countless hours on. Plz like to support my belief on becoming this man by liking. By liking you will create the dankest memes from now on and will be instantly famous on our beloved website 9gag witch i had recently failed to inject the donald into my cat, who sadly past away because there were impure memes in the paper, It was cancerous. <3 R.I.P FaZeRainTheCat. we will never forget.","tags":"#general#donald#the_donald#trump#13","favourites":0,"__v":0,"created_on":"2016-07-08T07:45:28.299Z","score":0},{"_id":"577f5a32c2b85a51055b3182","id":2834,"pasta":"So i went to this really ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ restaurant called the \"Pasta Palace\" and I really liked the food, service and overall mood of the restaurant, very ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ. First off, the smell is ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ. Its much better than the smell in my house, which is currently flooded in a pool of shit water from a toilet  I didn't flush. Anyways, other ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ aspects about this ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ restaurant is that the music is very ‚Ñ± ùì™ ùì∑ ùì¨ ùîÇ. The music actually made my ·ïô‡ºº‡∫àŸÑÕú‡∫à‡ºΩ·ïó dong ·ïô‡ºº‡∫àŸÑÕú‡∫à‡ºΩ·ïó rise a little bit. So I bet you're wondering about the food. The food is indeed very ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ. I ordered some pasta and I really liked the ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ smell, ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ taste and ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ touch of the pasta, it was all very ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ. Here's my complaint though. I realized that you can't pay with your dong in this particular restaurant. Yep, I asked the waiter if I could show the manager my ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ dong and that could cover my bill. You know what that bitch did? SHE KICKED ME OUT. Like jeez, who doesn't want their eyes to gaze in awe in sight of my very ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ ·ïô‡ºº‡∫àŸÑÕú‡∫à‡ºΩ·ïódong·ïô‡ºº‡∫àŸÑÕú‡∫à‡ºΩ·ïó? This restaurant is ass. Until they allow my ‚Ñ±ùì™ùì∑ùì¨ùîÇ  method of payment, i'll give the restaurant 1 out of 10 dong points. More like the \"pASSta palASSe\".","tags":"#general#dongers#reddit","favourites":0,"__v":0,"created_on":"2016-07-08T07:45:54.575Z","score":0},{"_id":"577f5a55c2b85a51055b3183","id":2835,"pasta":"You casuals don't understand the value of a good meme.
