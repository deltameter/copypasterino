After studying pepes for nearly 2 years, I decided it was time to create my own contribution to the world. But if I were to gaze upon my creation, to do so much as sniff at its rarity, it would be tarnished and be \"just another pepe\". So I had my eyes surgically removed, as well as my nose, ears, tongue, and all of the nerve endings in all of my body. I also took incredible amounts of various hallucinogens to alter my brain state so that I may not imagine what I was about to create.\nFor 30 days, without any senses to guide me, I carved at a large stone with just a butter knife and one of those toothpick things dentists use. Incredible visions of what could be danced in my head for this month, fueled by my LSD IV-drip. When I felt satisfied with whatever I had made, I buried this pepe rock underneath the soil at the hilltop where the Eldest Tree grows. I passed out from exhaustion. Sometime later a druid, come to visit the tree, found me. He used his druidly cunning to restore my senses with bits of rocks and twigs and flowers and the such. I thanked him and asked him to bless the earth where I buried the pepe. He went his way and, after my LSD-drip finally went dry, I went mine.\nAnd so there it rests, a pepe crafted of blood and magic, never known by any man, not even its creator. I can't tell you of its location, no man may gaze upon it. No man may even imagine what it may truly be like, this is just the way of my creation. BUT. You do know of its story. Or do you? Have I made up all of this just to whip up some imaginary un-attainable pepe to torment you? Perhaps. Perhaps I tell the truth, but know you won't believe me. Perhaps even I do not know what happened in truth, as I was super high for what I assume to be a month. Perhaps anything could've happened that magical night I decided to make my own pepe.\nAlas, I must go now. But heed my warning: Greed of pepe consumes all intentions. It is the great neutralizer. The good turn to pepe, the evil turn to pepe. Use that power with great care, for it is the power to change the fate of the world.","tags":"#therarestofpepes#4chan","favourites":4,"__v":0,"created_on":"2016-03-17T04:34:20.773Z","score":0.00012638368153155026},{"_id":"56ea339e709549ef048c48dc","id":2568,"pasta":"i was only 16 years old i loved chef so much i had all the merchandise and movies \"chef is love\" i say \"chef is life\" my dad hears me and calls me a sous chef i know he was just jealous of my devotion for chef i called him a cunt He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep i'm crying now my face hurts i lay in the kitchen, its really cold a warmth is moving towards me a feel a something touch me its chef i'm so happy he whispers in to my ear, \"my name is chef\" he grabs me with his powerful chef hands and puts me on my hands and knees i'm ready i open my oven for chef he puts his soufflé in my oven it burns but i do it for chef i can feel my oven melting as my eyes start water from the smoke i turn the heat up against his powerful soufflé i want to please chef he prepares a might meal and fills my oven with his spices my dad walks in","tags":"#chef#idubbbz#meme#general","favourites":1,"__v":0,"created_on":"2016-03-17T04:33:34.056Z","score":0},{"_id":"56ea338e709549ef048c48db","id":2567,"pasta":"You are about to get spammed with 600 dank memes.
