I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the fluffy tails institute, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Dire-side, and I have over 300 confirmed kills on my socketed gems. I am trained in jungle warfare and I’m the top ganker in the entire Radiant hero pool. You are nothing to me but just another fawn to enchant. I will heal you the sproink up with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on the shady lanes and sunny glades, mark my fluffy tail. You think you can get away with running that slow from me with my movespeed? Think again, my lovely. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of enchanted creeps across the river and your icon is being pinged right now so you better prepare for the darkened dapples, doe. The hoofprints that wipe out the lovely little thing you call your hp bar. Don't think I wasn't fawned of you, flower. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can heal you in over seven hundred nature attendants, and that’s just with my bare sproink. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed healing, but I have access to the entire arsenal of new tracks to follow and I will use them to their full extent to wipe your miserable frown upside down, you little thing you. If only you could have known what racked retribution your little “fast\" auto attacks was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have healed your golden tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now the buck stops here, points for trying though! I will impetus spears all over you and you will buckle down.

I know the morning Sheever came out in a dress she seemed fairly perturbed, though maybe I misjudged her reaction. I hopped on the stream briefly this morning and there was a 3rd woman present (short red hair? don't know her name) and chat was going ape shit begging for orgies and shit. There is a reason this hobby is so male dominated, and it's repugnant behavior like this. Grow the fuck up.
