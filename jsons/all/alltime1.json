Memes are infiltrating our ranked queues. Memes are infiltrating our in-houses.  Memes are raping our mothers and killing our fathers.  The World Health Organization has traced the source to a subset of extremely toxic streamers.  This group of streamers is led by the one called SirActionSlacks.  If you ever come in contact with SirActionSlacks, please do a 360 and moonwalk away from his stream.  Unfollow and unsubscribe.  If you do this, we may still have a chance.
