The research is as follows. Pocket-protected scientists built a wall of iron and crashed a diamond car into it at 400 miles per hour, and the car was unharmed. They then built a wall out of diamond and crashed a car made of iron moving at 400 miles an hour into the wall, and the wall came out fine. They then crashed a diamond car made of 400 miles per hour into a wall, and there were no survivors. They crashed 400 miles per hour into a diamond traveling at iron car. Western New York was powerless for hours. They rammed a wall of metal into a 400 mile per hour made of diamond, and the resulting explosion shifted the earth's orbit 400 million miles away from the sun, saving the earth from a meteor the size of a small Washington suburb that was hurtling towards mid-western Prussia at 400 billion miles per hour. They shot a diamond made of iron at a car moving at 400 walls per hour, and as a result caused over 9000 wayward airplanes to lose track of their bearings, and make a fatal crash with over 9000 buildings in downtown New York. They spun 400 miles at diamond into iron per wall. The results were inconclusive. Finally, they placed 400 diamonds per hour in front of a car made of wall traveling at miles per iron, and the result proved without a doubt that diamonds were the hardest metal of all time, if not the hardest metal known to man.","tags":"#general#miles#per#iron#diamonds#metal","favourites":202,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-17T23:10:49.326Z","score":0.0027852078362020924},{"_id":"54b5d5858ba53a7c3326b4f3","id":165,"pasta":"work it ᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗ harder  \nmake it (ง •̀_•́)ง better  \ndo it ᕦ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕤ faster  \nraise ur ヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ donger  ","tags":"#dongers#harder#better#faster#stronger","favourites":193,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-01-14T02:31:49.010Z","score":0.0017648381787389827},{"_id":"54bf14322d74781f04a60379","id":311,"pasta":"Ｈｅｌｌｏ  Ｉ＇ｍ  Ｓｎｉｔｈ，  ｐｌａｙｉｎｇ  ｍｙ  ２０２１４３ｔｈ  ｇａｍｅ  ｏｎ  Ｃｈｅｎ．  Ｅｖｅｎ  ｔｈｏｕｇｈ  ｉｔ＇ｓ  ｔｈｅ  ｏｎｌｙ  ｈｅｒｏ  Ｉ  ｐｌａｙ  Ｉ  ｓｔｉｌｌ  ｓｕｃｋ  ａｔ  ｉｔ．  Ａｓ  ａ  ｃｏｍｐｅｎｓａｔｉｏｎ  ｆｏｒ  ｍｙ  ｌａｃｋ  ｏｆ  ｓｋｉｌｌ  Ｉ  ａｍ  ｇｏｉｎｇ  ｔｏ  ｂｕｙ  ａｌｌ  ｓｕｐｐｏｒｔ  ｉｔｅｍｓ  ａｎｄ  ｇａｎｋ  ｍｉｄ  ａｔ  ｌｖｌ  ２  ａｎｄ  ｆａｉｌ．  Ｔｈａｎｋｓ  ｆｏｒ  ｌｉｓｔｅｎｉｎｇ","tags":"#dota2#hello#snith#chen#only#hero#suck","favourites":189,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-01-21T02:44:07.591Z","score":0.001805388477279207},{"_id":"54c0077c3b0a330105ff5cf1","id":453,"pasta":"( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Every 60 seconds in Africa, a minute passes.

People often asked us if, because of this fact, it was fun to fly the jet. Fun would not be the first word I would use to describe flying this plane - intense, maybe, even cerebral. But there was one day in our Sled experience when we would have to say that it was pure fun to be the fastest guys out there, at least for a moment.\n\nIt occurred when Walt and I were flying our final training sortie. We needed 100 hours in the jet to complete our training and attain Mission Ready status. Somewhere over Colorado we had passed the century mark. We had made the turn in Arizona and the jet was performing flawlessly. My gauges were wired in the front seat and we were starting to feel pretty good about ourselves, not only because we would soon be flying real missions but because we had gained a great deal of confidence in the plane in the past ten months. Ripping across the barren deserts 80,000 feet below us, I could already see the coast of California from the Arizona border. I was, finally, after many humbling months of simulators and study, ahead of the jet. I was beginning to feel a bit sorry for Walter in the back seat.\n\nThere he was, with no really good view of the incredible sights before us, tasked with monitoring four different radios. This was good practice for him for when we began flying real missions, when a priority transmission from headquarters could be vital. It had been difficult, too, for me to relinquish control of the radios, as during my entire flying career I had controlled my own transmissions. But it was part of the division of duties in this plane and I had adjusted to it. I still insisted on talking on the radio while we were on the ground, however. Walt was so good at many things, but he couldn't match my expertise at sounding smooth on the radios, a skill that had been honed sharply with years in fighter squadrons where the slightest radio miscue was grounds for beheading. He understood that and allowed me that luxury. Just to get a sense of what Walt had to contend with, I pulled the radio toggle switches and monitored the frequencies along with him.\n\nThe predominant radio chatter was from Los Angeles Center, far below us, controlling daily traffic in their sector. While they had us on their scope (albeit briefly), we were in uncontrolled airspace and normally would not talk to them unless we needed to descend into their airspace. We listened as the shaky voice of a lone Cessna pilot who asked Center for a read-out of his ground speed. Center replied: “November Charlie 175, I'm showing you at ninety knots on the ground.”\n\nNow the thing to understand about Center controllers was that whether they were talking to a rookie pilot in a Cessna or to Air Force One, they always spoke in the exact same, calm, deep, professional tone that made one feel important. I referred to it as the \"Houston Center voice.\" I have always felt that after years of seeing documentaries on this country's space program and listening to the calm and distinct voice of the Houston controllers, that all other controllers since then wanted to sound like that and that they basically did. And it didn't matter what sector of the country we would be flying in, it always seemed like the same guy was talking. Over the years that tone of voice had become somewhat of a comforting sound to pilots everywhere. Conversely, over the years, pilots always wanted to ensure that, when transmitting, they sounded like Chuck Yeager, or at least like John Wayne. Better to die than sound bad on the radios. Just moments after the Cessna's inquiry, a Twin Beech piped up on frequency, in a rather superior tone, asking for his ground speed in Beech. “I have you at one hundred and twenty-five knots of ground speed.”\n\nBoy, I thought, the Beechcraft really must think he is dazzling his Cessna brethren. Then out of the blue, a navy F-18 pilot out of NAS Lemoore came up on frequency. You knew right away it was a Navy jock because he sounded very cool on the radios. “Center, Dusty 52 ground speed check.” Before Center could reply, I'm thinking to myself, hey, Dusty 52 has a ground speed indicator in that million-dollar cockpit, so why is he asking Center for a read-out? Then I got it, ol' Dusty here is making sure that every bug smasher from Mount Whitney to the Mojave knows what true speed is. He's the fastest dude in the valley today, and he just wants everyone to know how much fun he is having in his new Hornet. And the reply, always with that same, calm, voice, with more distinct alliteration than emotion: “Dusty 52, Center, we have you at 620 on the ground.”\n\nAnd I thought to myself, is this a ripe situation, or what? As my hand instinctively reached for the mic button, I had to remind myself that Walt was in control of the radios. Still, I thought, it must be done - in mere seconds we'll be out of the sector and the opportunity will be lost. That Hornet must die, and die now. I thought about all of our Sim training and how important it was that we developed well as a crew and knew that to jump in on the radios now would destroy the integrity of all that we had worked toward becoming. I was torn. Somewhere, 13 miles above Arizona, there was a pilot screaming inside his space helmet. \n\nThen, I heard it - the click of the mic button from the back seat. That was the very moment that I knew Walter and I had become a crew. Very professionally, and with no emotion, Walter spoke: “Los Angeles Center, Aspen 20, can you give us a ground speed check?” There was no hesitation, and the replay came as if was an everyday request. “Aspen 20, I show you at one thousand eight hundred and forty-two knots, across the ground.”\n\nI think it was the forty-two knots that I liked the best, so accurate and proud was Center to deliver that information without hesitation, and you just knew he was smiling. But the precise point at which I knew that Walt and I were going to be really good friends for a long time was when he keyed the mic once again to say, in his most fighter-pilot-like voice: “Ah, Center, much thanks, we're showing closer to nineteen hundred on the money.” For a moment Walter was a god. And we finally heard a little crack in the armor of the Houston Center voice, when L.A. came back with, “Roger that Aspen. Your equipment is probably more accurate than ours. You boys have a good one.”\n\nIt all had lasted for just moments, but in that short, memorable sprint across the southwest, the Navy had been flamed, all mortal airplanes on freq were forced to bow before the King of Speed, and more importantly, Walter and I had crossed the threshold of being a crew. A fine day's work. We never heard another transmission on that frequency all the way to the coast. For just one day, it truly was fun being the fastest guys out there.","tags":"#general#blackbird","favourites":152,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-17T20:20:03.823Z","score":0.002192477106643042},{"_id":"54e02a0026efea8810640220","id":794,"pasta":" ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ༼ຈ ل͜ຈ༽ﾉ•︻̷┻̿═━一 ｈｏｈｏ　ｈａｈａ　ｓｈｒａｐｎｅｌヽ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ﾉ•︻̷┻̿═━一 ヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ｀、ヽヽ｀ヽ、ヽヽ｀ヽ","tags":"#dota2#shrapnel#sniper","favourites":148,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-02-15T05:02:49.424Z","score":0.0017187648173132455},{"_id":"54b59324e90c10d22e88b982","id":128,"pasta":"Forsen enters his bedroom and notices something unusual.

What this means is that for\neach year the MP3 sits on your hard drive, it will lose roughly 12kbps,\nassuming you have SATA – it’s about 15kbps on IDE, but only 7kbps on\nSCSI, due to rotational velocidensity. You don’t want to know how much\nworse it is on CD-ROM or other optical media.\n\nI started\ncollecting MP3s in about 2001, and if I try to play any of the tracks I\ndownloaded back then, even the stuff I grabbed at 320kbps, they just\nsound like crap. The bass is terrible, the midrange…well don’t get me\nstarted. Some of those albums have degraded down to 32 or even 16kbps.\nFLAC rips from the same period still sound great, even if they weren’t\nstored correctly, in a cool, dry place. Seriously, stick to FLAC, you\nmay not be able to hear the difference now, but in a year or two, you’ll\nbe glad you did.","tags":"#general#audio#FLAC","favourites":139,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-17T20:29:34.751Z","score":0.0020341181131588574},{"_id":"54bf32603b0a330105ff5bc2","id":353,"pasta":"ʜᴇʟʟᴏ ʙᴜʟʟᴅᴏɢᴇ I ᴀᴍ ғᴀᴍᴏᴜs ᴘᴏʀɴ ᴅɪʀᴇᴄᴛᴏʀ, ᴛᴏɴʏ ᴘᴀsᴛᴇʀɪɴᴏ. ᴡᴇ ᴡᴏᴜʟᴅ ʟɪᴋᴇ ʏᴏᴜ ᴀɴᴅ sʜᴇᴇᴠᴇʀ ᴛᴏ ᴘᴀʀᴛɪᴄɪᴘᴀᴛᴇ ɪɴ ᴏᴜʀ ɴᴇᴡ ᴠɪᴅᴇᴏ \" ʜᴏᴏᴋɪɴ' ɴ ᴊᴜᴋᴇɪɴ' \" sʜᴇᴇᴠᴇʀ ᴡᴏᴜʟᴅ ʙᴇ ᴡɪɴᴅʀᴜɴɴᴇʀ ᴀɴᴅ ʏᴏᴜ sᴀʏ ɴᴏ ᴊᴜᴋᴇʀɪɴᴏ ᴀɴᴅ ʙᴀᴄᴋᴅᴏᴏʀ ʜᴇʀ.","tags":"#dota2#admiralbulldog#porn#sheever#jukerino#backdoor","favourites":134,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-01-21T04:42:26.764Z","score":0.00135370446772146}]
