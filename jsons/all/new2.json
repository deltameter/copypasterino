My father was the kingpin of the Siberian mafia, so I had a family to raise me. Raised by the drug lords of the mafia, I grew up cooking meth for Siberia's finest junkies. When I was 17 years old I was cooking up a batch of meth, and I was distracted by a new guy, and I added the wrong thing and blew my arm off, and had 3rd degree burns on 34% of my body. Months down the line I had recovered. I had recieved a prosthetic arm. I went back to the only thing I was good at, making meth. Shortly after the Siberian SWAT team raided my house and I shot at them, I killed one, and I was quickly subdued. They shot me in the kneecap with a .45 and it shattered my knee. My leg was amputated. After my recovery I was admitted to the worst maximum security penitentary in Siberia. My sentence was 30 to life. 16 months into my sentence I had affiliated my self with a few members of my father's mafia. They told me they knew a way out, I agreed to go with them. We snuck through the vents and made our way outside. We saw guard shaks everywhere, we hugged the walls as tight as we could trying to be unseen. As we saw a area you could crawl under the fence, an ear shattering alarm was sounded. all of the guard towers spotlights were pointed at us. I heard a gun shot, they hit on of the members, he is dead. Me and the other member made our way through the fence and ran as fast as we could where we couldnt be seen. We thought they gave up, they found us 2 miles away and killed my last friend. I stole one of their guns and killed both of them. I made my way back to my home town, I couldnt function correctly, they were my bestfriends. They comforted me during my sentence and now they're dead. I went back to cooking drugs but something was different, this time I was using my product. I quickly became addicted and was stealing from the mafia. One of the kingpin's assistants found out and told the boss. The boss wasnt happy and wanted me to pay for it or die. I tried to get out of town knowing that I wouldnt be able to pay them back. 4 years later they found me. They had guns and baseball bats. They asked me where the money was and i told them I didnt have it. One of the members hit me with a bat and broke my jaw. Another one shot me in my foot. I was completely immobile. I was scared for my life as the boss lowered his handgun towards my head, then i heard a familiar noise. It was a seal. The seal rushed the boss and 360 tail whipped him in the skull and he got thrown the wall. The rest of the members tried to fight him, but he was to powerful for them. The seal had killed them all. The seal came to me and said \"Now do you believe?\" and fucked my bullet wound and ascended into the dark sky. That was the story in how I started worshipping the seal gods.
