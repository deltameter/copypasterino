He closed his eyes and made a quick prayer to Gaben.\n\"Through this sacrifice, may I prove worthy to receive that which I would most desire.\"\nHis eyes opened. It would be a great sacrifice indeed; but it would be worth it. OSFrog knew he had enough excesses to cover it. Terrorblade will receive an immortal in treasure 2, he promised himself. I have paid the price. He eyed the pentagram, a small urn sitting in the centre of it.\nWith that, he began the ritual, smoothly sliding down his pants and whipping out his stiffy, pre-lubed and harder than a level 16 Tiny. He intoned a demonic chant as he jerked his chodelike Chinese meat, slowly at first but growing faster with each stroke. He aimed the tip at the urn and moved his free hand over to his computer. His mouse moved quickly; he opened the recycle tab, tossing in items. The Marauder's Reflection set disappeared first, followed by the Eternal Purgatory. The remaining Terrorblade items formed a pentagram, the arcana at the centre. A humming noise filled the air, volume intensifying. As the screen started to glow a dark crimson, Jacky Mao came with the force of a thousand suns, and his hot load audibly splashed into the urn. A deep, throaty chuckle issued from his speakers, and everything went dark.\nWhen EE came to, the urn had disappeared, and a note was left in its place. He dashed over, tripping over his pants that were still down around his spindly ankles, and his eyes drank in the text.\nShriek when you see me.\nEternalEnvy sat down, and started giggling. His giggling grew louder, more maniacal, until the neighbours knocked on the door to complain, but he didn't care.

The spice burned my throat, my tongue, my mouth, my soul. Spaghetti, my true love, which I engulfed with great speed, damaged me more than you could ever understand. You don't get it. All these memes and jokes about spaghetti, but I've loved it since I was born. It was perfect. Not the noodles, not just pasta. Spaghetti. Pasta with meat sauce. No one will understand me when I say this, but I have an undying love for spaghetti. And having that spice betray me like that? I don't think I can go through anything like this again. I can taste it, months later, I can taste the burn of betrayal. It hurts. When I was young, I remember the peaceful bliss of stuffing myself with the spaghetti, smooth and silky, the perfect food, the perfect taste. All of my happiness, and bliss, ripped away by just once spice. The pain of this is too much to bear, but I must go on.

Memes are made by the greatest minds on the planet. Each one is carefully and delicately crafted to get the most amount of karma on Reddit. I'm led to believe that maybe even Albert Einstein made a meme. Now, I am not talking about the shitty Facebook memes that don't take any effort at all, like what you see on say, for example, Berny Snaders' page. They lack a soul. I only speak of 4Chan memes and the like. Things like dank pepe, dat boi (o shit waddup) and troll faces. These types of memes deserve respect. They aren't trash. They are art.
