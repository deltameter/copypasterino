For example in football your goal could be made bigger by moving the goalposts if your team is winning a lot. Or maybe they could count one goal as two goals for the team that is behind. Or maybe punish leading team more for their mistakes. Red card instead of yellow and so on.\nI think comeback mechanics are the future of all competitions, as they make watching much more pleasant experience since you can't be sure if the best team wins or loses.","tags":"#dota2#comeback#satire#football","favourites":46,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-24T00:39:29.761Z","score":0.0008188627138752553},{"_id":"54b5d5ff8ba53a7c3326b4f7","id":167,"pasta":"◥█̆◤ TOTEMIC MIGHT ◥█̆◤","tags":"#hearthstone#hs#reynad#totemic#might","favourites":45,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-01-14T02:34:02.461Z","score":0.0005078918125725914},{"_id":"54befef1e99bf86b74870e75","id":292,"pasta":"⋛⋋( ՞ਊ ՞)⋌⋚ CAW CAW ⋛⋋( ՞ਊ ՞)⋌⋚","tags":"#dota2#donger#caw#cawcaw#phoenix","favourites":45,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-01-21T01:11:28.999Z","score":0.0005282516099600714},{"_id":"55087f8a9c40b758059984a4","id":1051,"pasta":"Look who it is again, ID Heaven.

Sometimes while I'm out nerfing with my buddies, and I'm camped out in a sniper position, I get the urge to lick her dried pussy juices off my Longshot.

Alliance eliminated in group stage. Na'Vi eliminated. C9 eliminated. EG eliminated. Na'Vi.US eliminated just kidding they are nobody's favorite team. I don't need anyone on this subreddit to explain to me the nature of competition, and how teams can only either win and continue playing, or lose and drop out. I don't want to hear that shit. When is IceFrog going to nerf Chinese teams? I think next year's International should be patched so that only one or two Chinese teams can enter the competition. Failing that, we need GabeN to make another version of the International, called the Americas where only teams from North America and Europe can play.\n2) Boring playstyle. It's well known that the Chinese have the rare ability to make any playstyle boring. This is evidenced by the fact that they are playing the exact style that old Na'Vi were famous for (KILLFUCKINGEVERYTHING), yet it is still somehow boring. If they rice for 90 minutes it's boring. If Burning's Naga rats, it's boring. If they play deathball it's boring. Over 1kill/minute in every single game of this year's Grand Final? Get out of here with that math shit. Everyone knows the ideal Kill-per-minute is around 0.75kpm to 0.96322kpm. Anything outside of this arbitrary range is FUKCNG BOIRNG. Also games are ending too soon, which brings me to my next point.\n3) Games are ending too soon. Games should last at least 30 minutes, or how else will I be able to slack off at work long enough to last the work day? I don't want to hear the fact that how long games last for is entirely out of the players' control. They're here to entertain me, goddammit. All I care about is watching some good ol' 'Murican DOTO while I drink my Bud Light. I can't even get decently buzzed on a 15 minute game.\n4) Same picks every single game by the Chinese.They pick the same damn picks every round and win it's so disgusting. This year’s Grand Final had the same picks like Shadow Shaman, Nature’s Prophet, Ancient KAPPArition and Sand King every game. Why can’t it be like last year's Grand Final between two tax paying, Aryan teams where we had Wisp, Batrider, Alch and Nature's Prophet every game instead? I think Chinese teams need to vary their picks more, because they are playing for my enjoyment as an audience member and I can't enjoy DOTA when they keep conforming to tradition and picking the same heroes every game. The games need to be more like TI2 where there was the same strat and same heroes in every single game, or TI3 where there was the same strat and same heroes in every single game, or even TI1 where we had the same strat and same heroes every game. Picking a strategy again that worked before in a tournament for money makes no sense at all. Fucking Chinese have no originality.\n5) Nationalism. There were rumors floating around that NewBee are racists and love China. This is despicable. America is the only country anyone should feel any pride for. This is evidenced by the fact that nobody cares when the crowd cheers USA USA USA but posts about Chinese nationalism makes the front page on this subreddit. Martin Luther King Jr. turned around in his grave today because RACISM FUKCIN WON. Also, in a rare turn of events, Communism won as well for the first time in history.\n6) I don't feel any emotional connection to the players. How am I supposed to feel any emotional connection to these faceless Chinese players? They all look the same, for Chrissakes. What happened to God-fearing, Liberty-loving Americans like ppd who's twitter literally makes me cry with emotion? (https://twitter.com/ppdDota). Or Universe, who I barely know since he has a grand total of three interviews under his belt? Or Mason, who's xenophobia in-game rivals my own closeted mistrust for other ethnicities? Or the stone-faced zai? Or Arteezy, the honorary American? These Chinese players are mechanical and emotionless, nevermind the fact that I've never bothered to learn anything about them.\n7) A team that is not from the U.S. won. (Na'Vi are an exception, because they are white) This is by far the biggest reason why this year's International sucks. First of all, it's well known that the U.S. wins everything. it should have won this competition too. We win the Olympics. We win at Baseball. We win at Basketball. We win at soccer. We won in Vietnam and Iraq. We DESERVE to win this. It is our God given RIGHT to win. How dare the Chinese take this win from us.","tags":"#dota2#ti4#international#china#newbee#usa","favourites":44,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-01-14T04:37:28.878Z","score":0.0004984924099448363},{"_id":"55087de59c40b7580599849e","id":1047,"pasta":"My name is nick and I dream of becoming a dragon. People tell me I'm a dragonkin and I like the ring of that. I'm saving up money to have wings made out of my ribs and skin attached to my back. I've recently began drinking pure ethanol and swallowing matches. Nothing has happened yet, except I've had to have my stomach pumped 4 times; and the doctors are telling me to stop ingesting ethanol. Can you believe those cis white males in the STEM field? They're telling me to give up on my dream? This is why I need feminism, so I can't be discriminated against for drinking ethanol so I can be a dragon. I thought this was 2015? Social justice should be all over this. Anyways, I told those doctors they were scum, and to check their privilege. I then went on Tumblr and posted about it, inciting a response from other rational, like-minded people; who then emailed the hospital, informing them of the oppression and getting those monster “doctors” fired. Being thankful to the awesome tumblr community, I bravely volunteered to spy on an internet cesspit known as 4chan. I was promptly triggered and asked them to stop, to which they proceeded to call me offensive words and posted even more triggering material. I then self-diagnosed myself with PTSD and told Tumblr about it. I was amazed with the outcome! They started a hashtag called #stop4Chan. That's when I decided to use the pronouns xe/xim/xer to describe my self. As well, I've started to wear some classier clothes, so now I wear a fedora. With great class comes great privilege, so I tell 4chan I'll hack them. That's how I decided I'm a dragonkin.","tags":"#general#dragonkin#dream#dragon","favourites":44,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-17T18:43:00.099Z","score":0.0007505086462481261},{"_id":"54ce925b574e442b035d5fc5","id":651,"pasta":"Scientists have been pondering for ages how the universe keeps expanding, when by chance they were watching a televised Dota 2 tournament... suddenly they realized - it's iceiceice creating space","tags":"#dota2#scientists#universe#iceiceice#space#created","favourites":43,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-02-01T15:17:04.497Z","score":0.0005441846538137536},{"_id":"54d81ddcb898625b08cd362a","id":741,"pasta":"i expect us to win every lan\" - s4 2015","tags":"#dota2#s4#lan#tournament","favourites":43,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-02-09T02:36:25.354Z","score":0.0005699364721714646},{"_id":"5508d9dbb47c3d010fd96568","id":1119,"pasta":"geraffes are so dumb.\nEDIT: sorry, the only reason i say this is that this geraffe in this picture is trying to eat a painting. i should say that this one particular geraffe is dumb.\nEDIT: hey asshats quit downvoting me i am not the one who tried to eat the wall.\nEDIT: hey before you hit that down arrow why don't you ask yourself why you can't take a joke you losers. jesus the pc crap has extended to long horses? because that is all those things are, and no one was bawling when that chimp got shot for eating that lady's face. so are you racist for long horses over gorillas? hippocrites.\nEDIT: is it a bunch of peta lamebrains doing this? did my one little joke hit some kind of tree-hugger blog or some shit? i have never so much as even spit on a geraffe! wtf? i ate lion one time, it was in a burger; i had alligator, and something they told me was eagle but i'm positive it was just chicken. whatever anyone is saying about me and geraffes is not even true. but go on farteaters, downvote away. it shows how stupid you are.\nEDIT: spelling.\nEDIT: this is such shit. i have never received as much as one single downvote in my life and you peckers are jumping on this stupid geraffe-loving bandwagon. that is a dumb goddamn wall-licking geraffe and that is all. i'm not going to apologize to you idiots any more.\nEDIT: you know, now my feelings are hurt. the amount of downvotes piled on me is just excessive. god for-fucking-bid i had commented on a post about an antteater, i would be at -1000 by now. you people are horrible","tags":"#reddit#giraffes#geraffes#long#horses","favourites":43,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-18T01:48:59.267Z","score":0.0007376227686883324},{"_id":"54b59746e90c10d22e88b986","id":130,"pasta":" (_̅_̅_̅_̅_̲м̲a̲я̲i̲j­̲u̲a̲n̲a̲_̅_̅_̅()ด้็็็็็้็็็็็้็็็็็้็็็็็้็็็็็้็็็็็้็็็็็","tags":"#general#marijuana#weed#joint","favourites":42,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-01-13T22:08:02.381Z","score":0.00047837331103633886},{"_id":"54b6b333f6a1885137f43d01","id":199,"pasta":"☐ Not REKT \n\n☑ REKT \n\n☑ REKTangle \n\n☑ SHREKT \n\n☑ REKT-it Ralph \n\n☑ Total REKTall \n\n☑ The Lord of the REKT \n\n☑ The Usual SusREKTs \n\n☑ North by NorthREKT \n\n☑ REKT to the Future \n\n☑ Once Upon a Time in the REKT \n\n☑ The Good, the Bad, and the REKT \n\n☑ LawREKT of Arabia \n\n☑ Tyrannosaurus REKT \n\n☑ eREKTile dysfunction","tags":"#general#twitch#rekt#checkboxes","favourites":42,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-01-14T18:10:31.549Z","score":0.00048060714655884007},{"_id":"5508c796b47c3d010fd96531","id":1097,"pasta":" └( ° ͜ʖ͡°)┐Born too late to explore the Earth, born too soon to explore the Galaxy.
