For example in football your goal could be made bigger by moving the goalposts if your team is winning a lot. Or maybe they could count one goal as two goals for the team that is behind. Or maybe punish leading team more for their mistakes. Red card instead of yellow and so on.\nI think comeback mechanics are the future of all competitions, as they make watching much more pleasant experience since you can't be sure if the best team wins or loses.","tags":"#dota2#comeback#satire#football","favourites":46,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-03-24T00:39:29.761Z","score":0.0008332965146267768},{"_id":"54b5d1ff8ba53a7c3326b4e6","id":156,"pasta":"Well, I'm ready with my can of Monster Energy.
