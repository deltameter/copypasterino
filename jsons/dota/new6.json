I mean if u put 100 4K MMR players to 2K how many can go to 4K? probebly near 5-10 .The skill bracket is status of player but i care for gameplay in many matches i get players who dont even know the hero abilities i just want to go the bracket where all players can make game better Shudnt they make a new analyzing for old experianced players like..... Multiple kills, Fountain kills, 1 vs Multi enemy hero fight and multi kill them, Aegis still , rosh kills , wins, denies, saving allice, jukes..... but i think gpm xpm total dmg, last hits this for farmer heros only where some player plays support heros and they get disadvantage ......Now many will think this is stupid 2K MMR player lets just downvote it......All comments accepted.....","tags":"#dota2#2kmmr#shitter","favourites":0,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-06-20T04:03:49.932Z","score":0},{"_id":"55864e455690838c060c5cde","id":1787,"pasta":"\"He's a bad player, a bit underrated in my opinon, but definately okay for a T3 team!
