Comments on each thread literally are worse than twitch chat. Flaming, shaming players for losing, etc. instead of talking about how fucking good CDEC is and how they are destroying everyone, peoeple would rather upvote a thread flaming C9 and highlighting every single mistake players made. get a fucking life. This TI definitely made it clear that reddit is full of 12 year olds who like to talk about others mistake to somehow make themselves feel good. If you are a fan and your team disappointed you, imagine what players must be going through. yeah no shit navi wasn't the best team going into this TI, and no shit artstyle should have graved antimage, but obviously he double clicked on grave, shit happens, people make mistakes, its not like artstyle single handedly lost the games. I'm pretty sure this is going to get down voted but yeah, truth hurts, reddit is turning into twitch chat.","tags":"#dota2#reddit#flame","favourites":0,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-08-15T06:50:36.426Z","score":0}]
