Evil Genius vs Team Secret; Game Five\nAmazingly, Evil genius has managed to turn it around, and scrounge up two victories despite the first two games of the grand finals being devastating losses. Arteezy’s Max Backstab Riki build simply proved too strong for Evil Geniuses. Thankfully, while PPD was rushed to the medical tent to be treated for Salt poisoning Fear took his seat and banned it, but to complicate things further, Ice Frog, hallow be his name, took Suma1l’s advice from DACC at the start of the series, patching him out of reality, and into the game, where he became the new Storm Spirit. Fortuanatly, Gabe Newell’s son, Mason was on hand to take his place.\nEG thought they might actually be able to beat Secret in the final game, as S4 didn’t ban Suma1l Spirit, because he is cool. However, Secret finally breaks out their last pocket start, drafting Arteezy safelane farm techies. He builds midas first, followed by five more midases. Evil Geniuses were not expecting this, and are unable to counter it.Icefrog would later be quoted as saying “對不起，我真的很喜歡這個小怪物作為英雄”\nFinally, after three long hours, the game finally enters the mid game. Evil Geniuses, on radiant has been pushed back into their fountain, their ancient is exposed, Secret could end the game at any time, instead, they choose to fountain camp, killing Evil Geniuses over and over again. Finally, they drag Fear out, kicking and screaming, and bring him to Arteezy.\nFear’s life support system has begun to fail irl, both of his arms have snapped, yet he somehow managed to escape his base and take Dire’s top lane tier one, the first tower they have lost all game. Secret pledges to make an example of him.Arteezy must deal the final blow, to prove his loyalty to Secret, who have just revealed they are sponsored by Isis and the Illuminati.\nArteezy draws his midas, and prepares to deal the final blow, he fights back tears as he prepares to do what he knows he must. “Artour…” Fear finally says. “You were the last hope of NA dota.” Then fear dies irl and in game. there is no respawn timer. The audience falls silent, everyone can clearly hear the maniacal laughter of Team Secret. Finally, after several minutes, Zai stops laughing long enough to ask Arteezy why he is crying. “He was just some old man,” he reminds him.\nNo one is able to hear Arteezy’s response over the laughter. “He wasn’t just ‘some old man.’ He was my father.” The caliber of his sins are too much and as a final act of repentance, he screams “SUICIDE SQUAD, ATTACK!” and uses the bombs gifted to him by his sponsors to destroy himself, and take out the rest of his team. Sensing a chance to win, the Mason/Suma1l Archon blast out of their base, zip zopping all they way to Dire’s ancient, as techies mines were rigged to destroy every building on the map.\nThen tragedy strikes. The same black magic Puppey and Kuroky used to kill Na’Vi has brought them back as undead abominations. Dendi throws a perfect hook at Suma1l Spirit, catching him just as he runs out of mana.\nThe EG survivors yell to the audience, “NA DOTA, LEND US YOUR STRENGTH” but nothing happens because the NA dota scene is a joke. Finally though, a lone figure stands up in the crowd. Drinking one last Red Bull, Demon grows wings, and ascends to a higher plane of existence, becoming a being of pure energy, then sacrificing himself to give Suma1l a single bloodstone charge and just enough mana to escape and kill the xboct ghost, causing him to drop six rapiers. \"Classic Jimmy.\" Say all three Merlinis. A single tear running down their collective faces.\nWith his final bit of mana, he rockets towards the dire ancient, but alas, he wasn’t fast enough. Admiralbulldog destroys both ancients simultaneously, forever proving Rat Dota is best dota, winning the game for Alliance. The Aegis still goes to China for some reason.","tags":"#ti5#dota2#finals#arteezy","favourites":23,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-08-13T03:42:33.114Z","score":0.013786846411446885},{"_id":"55c6e00793639d8d333a6436","id":1980,"pasta":"░░░░░░░░░░░▄▄▄▄▄ ░░░░░░░▄▄█████████▄▄ ░░░░▄▀▀▀▀█▀▀▀▀▀▀█████▄ ░░▄██████░░REPOST░░░▀██ ░▐██████▌░░TO░RESURRECT▐▌ ░███████▌░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█ ▐████████░░░░HITLER░░░░░░█ ▐██████▌░░░░░▄▀▀▀▀▀▄░▀░▄▄▌ ░█▀▀███▀░░░░░░▄▀█▀░░░▐▄▄▄▌ ▐░▌▀▄░░░░░░░░░░▄▄▄▀░░░▌▀░▌ ░▌▐░░▌░░░░░░░░░░░▀░░░░▐░▐ ░▐░▀▄▐░░░░░░░░░░░▌▌░▄▄░▐░▌ ░░▀█░▄▀░░░░░░░░░▐░▐▄▄▄▄▀▐ ░░░▌▀░▐░░░░░░░░▄▀░░▀▀▀▀░▌ ░░░▐░░░░░░░░░▌░░░▄▀▀▀▀▄▐ ░░░▌░░░░░░░░░▐░░░░░▄▄░░▌ ░░█▀▄░░░▐░▐░░░░░░░░░░░█ ░█░█░▀▀▄░▌░█░░░▀▀▄▄▄▄▀ █░░░▀▄░░▀▀▄▄█░░░░░▄▀ ░░░░░░▀▄░░░░▀▀▄▄▄▀▐ █░░░░░░░▀▄░░░░░▐░▌▐ ░█░░░░░░░░▀▄░░░▌░▐▌▐ ░░█░░░░░░░░░█░▐░▄▄▌░█▀▄ ░░░█░░░░░░░░░█▌▐░▄▐░░▀▄▀▀▄▄ ░░░░█░░░░░░░░░▀▄░░▐░░░▀▄░░░▀▀▄▄ ░░░░░▀▄░▄▀█░░░░░█░░▌░░░░▀▄░░░░░█ .....l","tags":"#dota2#ti5","favourites":28,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-08-09T05:07:19.082Z","score":0.010822446620932355},{"_id":"54b5d2228ba53a7c3326b4ed","id":163,"pasta":"ＨＥＹ　ＲＴＺ，　Ｉ’Ｍ　ＴＲＹＩＮＧ　ＴＯ　ＬＥＡＲＮ　ＴＯ　ＰＬＡＹ　ＲＩＫＩ．　Ｉ　ＪＵＳＴ　ＨＡＶＥ　Ａ　ＱＵＥＳＴＩＯＮ　ＡＢＯＵＴ　ＴＨＥ　ＳＫＩＬＬ　ＢＵＩＬＤ：　ＳＨＯＵＬＤ　Ｉ　ＭＡＸ　ＢＡＣＫＳＴＡＢ　ＬＩＫＥ　ＹＯＵ　ＢＡＣＫＳＴＡＢＢＥＤ　ＥＧ，　ＳＭＯＫＥＳＣＲＥＥＮ　ＳＯ　ＴＨＥＹ　ＭＩＳＳ　ＭＥ　ＬＩＫＥ　ＥＧ　ＭＩＳＳ　ＹＯＵ　７０％　ＯＦ　ＴＨＥ　ＴＩＭＥ，　ＯＲ　ＰＥＲＭＡＮＥＴ　ＩＮＶＩＳＩＢＩＬＩＴＹ　ＳＯ　Ｉ　ＣＯＵＬＤ　ＤＩＳＡＰＰＥＡＲ　ＬＩＫＥ　ＹＯＵ　ＤＩＳＡＰＰＥＡＲＥＤ　ＦＲＯＭ　ＥＧ","tags":"#dota2#rtz#arteezy#riki#eg","favourites":1491,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-01-14T02:18:08.093Z","score":0.009732936849708421},{"_id":"55cc12432ccec12862a3e7b8","id":1987,"pasta":"This is 17% luck, 17% skill, 17% concentrated power of will 17% pleasure; 17% pain, And a 17% reason to uninstall the game","tags":"#dota2#twitch","favourites":13,"__v":0,"created_on":"2015-08-13T03:42:59.973Z","score":0.008319818055842103},{"_id":"55c6e04c93639d8d333a6438","id":1982,"pasta":"Haiiiiiii! ^____^ It's your kawaii Queen of Pain-chan desu-ne!!!
