First off, the smell is ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂. Its much better than the smell in my house, which is currently flooded in a pool of shit water from a toilet  I didn't flush. Anyways, other ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 aspects about this ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 restaurant is that the music is very ℱ 𝓪 𝓷 𝓬 𝔂. The music actually made my ᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗ dong ᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗ rise a little bit. So I bet you're wondering about the food. The food is indeed very ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂. I ordered some pasta and I really liked the ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 smell, ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 taste and ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 touch of the pasta, it was all very ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂. Here's my complaint though. I realized that you can't pay with your dong in this particular restaurant. Yep, I asked the waiter if I could show the manager my ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 dong and that could cover my bill. You know what that bitch did? SHE KICKED ME OUT. Like jeez, who doesn't want their eyes to gaze in awe in sight of my very ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂 ᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗdongᕙ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽ᕗ? This restaurant is ass. Until they allow my ℱ𝓪𝓷𝓬𝔂  method of payment, i'll give the restaurant 1 out of 10 dong points. More like the \"pASSta palASSe\".","tags":"#general#dongers#reddit","favourites":0,"__v":0,"created_on":"2016-07-08T07:45:54.575Z","score":0}]
