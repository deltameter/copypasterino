Ever since I was a boy I dreamed of sending nudes to pro gamers about everything and having hot sticky fluids spread over pictures of me on redtube. People say to me that a person being a Hafu is Impossible and I'm fucking retarded and it's true, I'm an idiot. I'm having a plastic surgeon install a pretty cute face on my body. From now on I want you guys to call me \"Hafu\" and respect my right to be decent at Hearthstone and send my nudes to Kripp. If you can't accept me you're a hafuphobe and need to check your Rumay Wang privilege.
