My dad hears me and calls me a faggot. I know he was just jealous of my devotion for Trump. I called him a FORSEN BOY. He slaps me and sends me to go to sleep. I'm crying now, and my face hurts. I lay in bed and there is very little value. Suddenly, value is moving towards me. It's Trump. I am so happy. He whispers into my ear \"This is my Value Town.\" He grabs me with his powerful asian brain and puts me down onto my hands and knees. I'm ready. I spread my ass-cheeks for Trump. He penetrates my butt-hole. It hurts so much but I do it for Trump. I can feel my butt tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his value. I want to please Trump. He roars in a mighty roar as he fills my butt with his value. My dad walks in. Trump looks him straight in the eyes and says \"It's all value now.\" Frump tucks through my window. Frump is value.
